Hi, I'm Max! I'm a reformed mathematician, and enjoy thinking about the relationship between the technical aspects of systems and the humans co-creating, influenced and impacted by them. I'm aiming to build a career as a researcher - starting by getting into a DPhil program!

Currently, I'm studying a MSc in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute. My thesis explores the marginalisation of minority political perspectives by LLMs.
