**tech is not value-neutral - and neither is apathy**

Many of the most powerful aspects of AI also carry significant risks. Predictive analytics frequently prioritizes accuracy over fairness, unsupervised learning techniques can enable troubling population reductions, and deep learning models operate as mysterious black boxes whose decision-making processes remain largely unexplained.

The author argues that "the greatest drivers of value in data science are often not the shiny ML tricks themselves, but rather whatever methods are needed to improve customer and user outcomes."

## What can data scientists do?

- Decline projects involving problematic applications like surveillance, image recognition for monitoring, or systems promoting addictive behaviors
- Amplify diverse perspectives from both marginalized communities and different academic disciplines
- Speak up at their organizations—tech workers possess unusual leverage for change
- Share practical implementation challenges when applying ethics research
- Contribute financially to causes addressing these concerns

## Rejecting false choices

Rather than abandoning data science entirely, practitioners should acknowledge that reverting to traditional human decision-making doesn't eliminate bias—it merely obscures it.

## Reasons for optimism

Real progress is emerging through industry engagement, growing community awareness, and technology's demonstrated capacity to center user needs. The operationalization of ethical considerations is happening now, despite ongoing philosophical debates about frameworks.

The path forward requires addressing interconnected challenges: defining concepts precisely, translating ethics into quantifiable measures, scaling implementation organizationally, and managing inherent tensions.
