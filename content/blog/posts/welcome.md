Welcome to my new blog! This is a demonstration post showing some of the features available.

## Footnotes

Hugo supports footnotes natively.[^1] When you hover over the footnote reference, you'll see the footnote content appear in a popup.[^2]

[^1]: Footnotes are great for adding supplementary information without cluttering the main text.
[^2]: This hover functionality is implemented with a lightweight JavaScript enhancement.

## Citations

You can also cite references from your bibliography. For example, {{< cite "smith2020" >}} provides an excellent introduction to academic writing, while {{< cite "jones2021" "p. 45" >}} discusses research methods.

## Formatting

The site uses a **minimal brutalist design** with clean typography and simple borders. It focuses on readability and content over decoration.

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's styled with a simple left border.

### Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And unordered lists:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

## Bibliography

At the end of posts with citations, you can include a bibliography:

{{< bibliography >}}
