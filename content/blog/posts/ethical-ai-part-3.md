## Overview

Implementing ethical principles for a single machine learning model differs drastically from managing this challenge across hundreds of legacy systems within large organizations.

## Key Challenges

**Unified Optimization Problems**
Much of the academic literature treats ethics as a regularization term added to loss functions, but real-world deployments rarely have single utility functions governing all decisions.

**Workload and Accountability**
When one senior leader oversees 100 production models, effective oversight becomes impractical. The scale of responsibility exceeds what individual oversight can reasonably handle.

**Conflicting Principles**
Organizations face inherent tensions: detecting racial discrimination requires demographic data collection, yet privacy concerns, security risks, and misuse fears often prevent capturing this information.

**Organizational Structure**
- Data scientists lack appropriate tools and expertise
- Legal professionals are equally unprepared
- Adding Risk Management layers creates bureaucratic friction incompatible with agile development
- Distributing responsibility broadly often means nobody owns the outcome

**Performance Metrics**
Defining meaningful, measurable KPIs for algorithmic ethics remains elusive, raising concerns about Goodhart's Law distorting intended outcomes.

**Systemic Complexity**
The end-to-end nature of these problems spans multiple organizational departments, involving human touchpoints like customer service representatives, making comprehensive pipeline analysis extremely difficult.

**Leadership Gap**
"top-down problem: because a) these decisions are consequential and can land you in the news" but senior decision-makers typically lack technical grounding necessary for informed governance.
