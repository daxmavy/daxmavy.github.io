I studied a **Bachelors of Science (Advanced Mathematics)**, double-majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Sydney, including an **Honours year in Applied Mathematics** (translation for non-Australians: this is an additional research year tacked onto the end of an undergraduate degree). 

I then worked for ~5 years, first at Atlassian (in their Ecosystem team), and then at Canva (in their Trust & Safety team). I had a great time and learned a lot about how to solve real-world problems with data at scale.

However, the academic itch never left, so I'm back at uni! I'm currently studying a **MSc Social Data Science** at the University of Oxford. I'm aiming to get into a PhD program either this year or next.

You can see my (up-to-date as of Jan 2026) [CV here](/cv.pdf) with more details, including a bunch of internships and research projects.
