I'm Max. I'm interested in too many things.
-----
I work as a Behavioural Scientist at CBA and previously (also at CBA) as an Associate Data Scientist. I'm also an Honours student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Sydney. So far as I can tell, the more I learn, the more I realise how little I know, and the more I realise how much there is to find. This is a worrying trend, as it would be thoroughly unsatisfying if it continues for another 50 years. 

In this website, you may find:

- hot takes
- book reviews
- things I'm excited about
- ...and my CV (to all recruiters: please forgive the hot takes)

This website exists for three reasons:
- a project to learn git, Jekyll, and linux OS / development environment
- a place to refine the rants that I otherwise keep imposing on various passers-by
- an opportunity to reverse the damage done to my writing skills by 4 years of studying maths

This is still very much under construction!

An important proviso for the below: I'm more than wary of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) (or the far scarier [alternative](https://xkcd.com/1531/)). Where below I say 'a fair bit about' or 'just a little about', substitute 'next to nothing', and 'nothing', respectively.

Some areas that I know a fair bit about and find cool:
- Machine learning and data science
- Algorithm / mechanism design
- Maths, especially:
  - optimisation
  - probability theory
  - mathematical computing
  - topology
- Ethics in AI

Some areas that I know just a little about and find cool:
- Computational social science
- Natural language processing
- Software engineering
- 'Big Data' workflows
- Microeconometrics / causal inference
- Development economics
- Behavioural science and economics
- Linguistics
- Historiography
- Effective altruism

Some areas I know very little about and find cool:
- Writing 
- Design
- Anthropology
- Languages (currently attempting a horrific parallel attempt to learn both German and Portuguese at the same time)

Some fun facts:
- I once danced jazz ballet in the Opera House
- My family of 5 contains 4 nationalities
- When I eat cheese, my hearing dies
