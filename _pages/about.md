I'm Max. I'm interested in too many things.
-----
I work as a Behavioural Scientist at CBA and previously (also at CBA) as an Associate Data Scientist. I'm also an Honours student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Sydney.

Website
-----
In this website, you may find:

- hot takes
- book reviews
- things I'm excited about
- ...and my CV (to all recruiters: please forgive the hot takes)

This website exists for three reasons:
- a project to learn git, Jekyll, and linux OS / development environment
- a place to refine the rants that I otherwise keep imposing on various passers-by
- an opportunity to try to reverse the damage done to my writing skills by 4 years of studying maths

This is still very much under construction!
