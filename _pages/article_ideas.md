- my choices previously were based on constraints - now they are based on opportunities, and it is scary
- data science is a tool of the powerful, because of its key requirement - data!
- why have I chosen what's hard?
- the lie of the law degree: basic logic and an ability to read... (really about signalling)
- the problem of signalling in relationships (meta-meaning to your words) and life (choosing things because they signal something about yourself)
- playing with the levers of power
- balancing post-structuralism with saying anything at all
- question: to what extent does adapting to the condtions of oppression maintain them? data-based study
- maths not being as a growing tree, but rather as a collection people sharing knowledge (thurston stack overflow & essay)

- being privileged is the ability to discuss things in hypotheticals

- what is the purpose: explain the shape of thoughts in my head, record what is ordinarily not written down (extension of memory), 1000 words about anything and 3k words about nothing; chart the progress of my ideas over time

- how can someone be a critical practitioner? I've always had a very reductive image: there were people inside the walls, who could leverage the resources of power, but whose thoughts and actions were constrained. there are people outside the walls, banging on the gates, who are free to speak and think as they want. change happens through both these groups: the ones inside who listen to the shouting, moderate it as needed to modulate and change the system for the better, and the ones outside, who push the boundaries, use their external perspective and free voice to fight for what is right. the one inside the walls cannot simply join in the shouting, because then they will be tossed out. but they cannot be deaf, because otherwise they are contributing to grievous wrongs.

but when do you compromise too much? when are you simply fiddling with the levers of power, nominally making things better, but really just existing in a system which destroys people?

especially in the face of problems that require us all the push *together at once*, disregarding the possible ineffectiveness of our own specific action, but acting on the promise of what happens if we all were to give one great shove

I've always thought of people in the business and the institutions 


Ethics and AI:
1. What's in an explanation?
- can't use certain models in finance
- people are obsessed about 
2. Explicit ethical decisions
- opportunities
- difficulties
3. Quantitative ethics
4. Scalable ethics
5. AI isn't value-neutral
